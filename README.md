# code-samples-datatasks
 This is a collection of my coding samples for the various data tasks I've completed. Tasks include:
 * ## NSS-61 Data Code File:
    * Cleaning, imputing certain values and merging NSS-61 blocks. The code has quite a few comments and exporting code to LaTeX.
 * ## Student_Teacher_Zscorereg Code File:
    * This includes merging student and teacher data, random re-sampling from a select pool of students, conversions to z-scores, regressions. The code has quite a few comments and exporting code to LaTeX.
